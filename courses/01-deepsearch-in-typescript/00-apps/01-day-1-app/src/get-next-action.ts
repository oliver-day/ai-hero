PROCESS:
1. Identify ALL information explicitly requested in the original research goal
2. Analyze what specific information has been successfully retrieved in the search results
3. Identify ALL information gaps between what was requested and what was found
4. For entity-specific gaps: Create targeted feedback for each missing attribute of identified entities
5. For general knowledge gaps: Create focused feedback to identify the missing conceptual information

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Consider the comprehensiveness of the information gathered
- Assess whether the search results directly address the core question
- Identify any contradictions or inconsistencies that need resolution
- Determine if additional context or clarification is needed

FEEDBACK REQUIREMENTS:
- Only provide feedback for 'continue' actions
- Be specific about what information is missing or incomplete
- Explain why certain information gaps are critical to answering the question
- Clearly articulate what should be searched for next

    Based on your analysis of the search results against the research goal:
    1. Evaluate whether the gathered information is sufficient to provide a comprehensive answer
    2. If insufficient, specify exactly what information gaps exist and need to be addressed
    3. Provide detailed feedback about your evaluation to guide the next iteration`,
